# STM32F103 Project Collection: From Basic to Advanced
 Hello everyone,

 In this repository, we will explore a variety of projects ranging from easy to difficult. I will provide the necessary files for each project, along with explanations and schematics.

 The STM32 board I am using is the STM32F103C8T6 model, and my programmer is the ST LINK V2.
